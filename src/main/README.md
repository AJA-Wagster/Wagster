## Getting Started

#### Setting up <br> Getting started using Wagster is really simple. You'll need to clone the repository on to your computer. Get a MapBox API key and a FileStack APi key. Then you will need to run our MySQL Seeder file to populate the database.


#### API Key Setup <br> In order to utilize the full functionality of Wagster, you'll need to obtain two API keys: one from MapBox and another from FileStack. These keys will allow you to integrate mapping services and file handling capabilities into our application. Please sign up for MapBox and FileStack accounts if you don't have them already, and obtain your respective API keys.

#### Populating the Database <br> To populate the Wagster database with initial data, we provide a MySQL Seeder file. You can run this file to populate the necessary tables. Please ensure that you have MySQL installed and properly configured on your system before proceeding.

#### To run the MySQL Seeder file, execute the following command:

php seeder.php

#### This will initiate the database seeding process, ensuring that the required data is available for the proper functioning of Wagster.

#### Configuration <br> Before launching the application, make sure to update the configuration file with your API keys and any other necessary settings. Open the file in a text editor and update the relevant fields with your API keys and desired configurations.

#### Launching Wagster<br>Once you have completed the above steps, you're ready to launch Wagster! Execute the following command from the root directory of the project:


php -S localhost:8000
This will start a local development server hosting the Wagster application.

You can now access Wagster by opening your web browser and navigating to http://localhost:8000. Enjoy exploring and utilizing the features of Wagster!
